# Snapdrop
Android app (unofficial) for www.snapdrop.net

This app is a wrapper around [snapdrop project](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop) using webview and some javascript interface for downloads.

### Advantages
You can select files on your phone share it directly using this app, instead of opening a browser and searching for the files. 
I'm also planning to add a download/upload history section once the following issues are fixed.

### Known issues
- It changes the downloaded file name.
- Might not support downloading some file types. (Please create an issue, mention the file type and attach the file too, if possible.)
